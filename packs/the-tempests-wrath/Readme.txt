Tempest's Wrath: A Pirate Borg Adventure

Ahoy, adventurers!

The sea calls you to the shores of an untamed island, where storms rage like the wrath of vengeful gods, and ancient secrets pulse beneath the jungle’s tangled heart. The Altar of Storms waits at the island's summit, promising power... or doom. Only the bold, the cunning, and the fierce survive such trials.

Do you have what it takes to face the storm?
